### Added local preview based on node adapter [14:30]

Because I cannot get the development mode to work locally (for now) and from the docs it seems, that it is quite different from the production mode, I decided to use the node adapter for a local preview. I have installed it with `pnpm install @astrojs/node` and added the following switch to `astro.config.ts`:

```ts
const adapter =
  process.env.ADAPTER === "node"
    ? node({
        mode: "standalone",
      })
    : vercel();
```

In `package.json` I have added the following script:

```json
    "preview": "ADAPTER=node astro build; ADAPTER=node astro preview"
```

### Offline support [14:45]

I read up on Joaqu√≠n comments in Discord and it seems, that I need to spend some more thoughts into offline functionality:

- SSG: Static pages seem fairly straight forward, they could be made dynamic with some islands, the islands should be aware of the offline state
  - the disadvantage would be, that we might offload rendering to our users' (low-end) devices
  - what would be the difference to a SPA, then? Wouldn't a SPA be better?
- SSR: Server-rendered pages
